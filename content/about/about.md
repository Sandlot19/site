Hi my name is Jacob, I'm a Software Engineer and Computer Scientist.

<!--more-->

Currently, I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, studying with Dr. Austin Henley.
I'm creating this site to share interesting findings, my experience in my Doctoral program, and anything else that I think would be fun to write a little blurb about!

I love to write systems code. C, C++, and Rust are some of my favorite languages, getting right down to the bits and bytes of a program is where I thrive. I've spent time working on both Android and ChromeOS platforms during my internships, both times working on their network stacks, bluetooth and eSIM, respectively. I plan use this experience to focus my research around distributed systems, with a focus on distributed concensus. Initial research will go into the Paxos family of algorithms, and then will look into adapting and modifying the family into blockchain and other distributed networks.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, tv series, and the occasional Broadway play.  

Currently I'm enjoying the final season of Game of Thrones, rewatching Silicon Valley, and looking forward to seeing Finding Neverland at the Tennessee Theatre next month
